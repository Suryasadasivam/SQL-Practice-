# SQL-Practice- 

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific programming language designed for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases. It is the standard language used to communicate with and operate on relational database management systems (RDBMS).

** SQL provides a standardized way to perform tasks such as:**

- Data Querying: Retrieving data from databases using SELECT statements.
- Data Manipulation: Inserting, updating, and deleting records in database tables using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
- Schema Definition: Creating and modifying database schemas, tables, views, indexes, and other database objects using CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements.
- Data Control: Managing access control and permissions on database objects using GRANT and REVOKE statements.
- Transaction Control: Ensuring data integrity and consistency by defining and managing transactions using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT statements.
- Data Constraints: Enforcing data integrity rules, such as primary key, foreign key, unique, and check constraints, to maintain data quality.
- Data Aggregation: Performing aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) to calculate summary statistics on datasets.
- Data Joins: Combining data from multiple tables using JOIN operations to retrieve related information.
- Data Filtering: Filtering data based on specific criteria using WHERE clauses.
- Data Sorting: Sorting query results in ascending or descending order using ORDER BY clauses.
- SQL is used in a wide range of applications and industries where relational databases are prevalent, including web development, data analysis, business intelligence, finance, healthcare, and more. It provides a powerful and flexible means of interacting with structured data, making it an essential skill for anyone working with databases or data-driven applications.
